# Titanic Survival Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts the survival of Titanic passengers based on relevant features using Python and various ML models.

# Features:
- Load and preprocess **CSV dataset**
- Train models: **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and a **Neural Network (TensorFlow)**
- Evaluate models using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**
- Compare results across models

# Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- TensorFlow / Keras

# How to run the project
1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VinhNguyen0505/titanic_survival_prediction.git
   cd titanic_survival_prediction
   ```

2. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the model training script:

   ```bash
   python titanic_model.py
   ```

4. Review accuracy and classification reports printed in the terminal.
